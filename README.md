Dataset may contain corrupted images

1. Check which images are incompatible with Tensorflow2 by running ```filter.py```; a ```files.to.delete.txt``` will be generated.
3. You can remove those images by using the ```utilities``` module as follow:

```python
    import utilities as ff
    ff.delete_from_list()
```
